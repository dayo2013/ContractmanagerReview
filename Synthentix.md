## REVIEW REPORT
###

### Welcome to Synthentix (SNX).
Synthetix is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol built on Ethereum and Optimistic Ethereum (a layer two scaling solution built on Ethereum). Synthetic assets, and associated products, are collateralized by stakers via Synthetix Network Token (SNX), which when locked in a staking contract enables the issuance of synthetic assets (synths). This pooled collateral model allows users to perform conversions between synths directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties. This mechanism solves the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by DEXs.

### pigin Nigeria version:
Synthetix na descentralized liquidity where dey dem make em on etheruem and optimistic protocol.sythentix they offer user where go stake with dem a collateral service for there token (snx) with this platform user if come convert there synths directly with smart contract.you no go need any third parties you go run your conversion without wahala.this method dey solve meta of liquidity and slippage wahala of dex.

### CONTRACT OVERVIEW.
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

 Is a keyword used for specifying compiler-specific information. It helps in indicating the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used to compile the code.
 
 PIGIN (TRANSLATION)
 Na very important keyword where solidity understand to compile code.
 ### import(13):

 The `import` statement in Solidity is employed professionally to incorporate and utilize code from other Solidity source files, fostering modularity and code reusability. This feature allows developers to organize their contracts into separate files and leverage common functionality across multiple contracts.

 PIGIN(TRANSLATION)
 
 Import dey help developers to share code from one solidity file to anoda file  without wahala .

 ### INTERFACES:

 In the Solidity programming language, an interface serves as a blueprint for a contract without specifying the implementation of its functionality. It articulates the functions, events, and occasionally state variables that are required to be implemented by another contract. Essentially, an interface sets forth a standardized set of rules or a protocol that other contracts are expected to adhere to. This mechanism promotes consistency and interoperability within a system by ensuring that contracts conform to a predetermined set of behaviors.

 PIGIN(TRANSLATION):
 Interface na like blueprint where developer if use when dem  dey write code all the person  need to do na to import the  interface but you go start the contract name with interface.

 ### CONTRACT COLLATERALMANAGER:

 This Solidity code defines the `CollateralManager` contract, showcasing a sophisticated design that incorporates multiple interfaces, including `ICollateralManager`, `Owned`, and `Pausable`, alongside the utilization of a mixin pattern with `MixinResolver`. Let's dissect the pivotal components:

1. **Interfaces Implementation**:
   - `ICollateralManager`: The contract implements the functions and declarations outlined in the `ICollateralManager` interface, signifying the obligation to furnish tangible implementations for the methods specified in `ICollateralManager`.
   - `Owned`: Presumably representing ownership functionality, the `CollateralManager` contract implements the requisite methods or variables to conform to the `Owned` interface.
   - `Pausable`: Analogous to `Owned`, this represents another interface or contract dealing with pausability. The `CollateralManager` contract includes the essential functions or state variables to support pausing functionality.

2. **Mixin Usage**:
   - `MixinResolver`: Employed as a mixin, adhering to the design pattern where a class is composed with methods from another class. In this instance, `MixinResolver` is amalgamated into the `CollateralManager` contract, implying the inclusion of functionality provided by `MixinResolver`. This fosters the reuse of code across multiple contracts.

3. **Libraries Usage**:
   - `using SafeMath for uint`: The `SafeMath` library, offering arithmetic functions with overflow and underflow protection, is integrated using the `using` statement. This allows direct utilization of `SafeMath` functions with `uint` in the contract.
   - `using SafeDecimalMath for uint`: Analogous to `SafeMath`, this library, likely tailored for decimal operations, is applied to `uint` in the contract.
   - `using AddressSetLib for AddressSetLib.AddressSet`: Suggesting the use of the `AddressSetLib` library for managing sets of addresses. The `using` statement provides additional functions to the `AddressSet` type from the library.
   - `using Bytes32SetLib for Bytes32SetLib.Bytes32Set`: Indicates the use of the `Bytes32SetLib` library for managing sets of `bytes32` values. Similar to the address set, the `using` statement enhances the `Bytes32Set` type with functions from the library.

In essence, the `CollateralManager` contract embodies a composition of diverse functionalities derived from interfaces (`ICollateralManager`, `Owned`, `Pausable`) and a mixin (`MixinResolver`). Additionally, it harnesses various libraries (`SafeMath`, `SafeDecimalMath`, `AddressSetLib`, `Bytes32SetLib`) to address specific requirements related to arithmetic operations, address sets, and `bytes32` sets. This design promotes modularity, code reuse, and adherence to standardized protocols.

PIGIN(TRANSLATION):
This Solidity code wey I write define the `CollateralManager` contract, wey show one kind ogbonge design wey carry many interfaces, including `ICollateralManager`, `Owned`, and `Pausable`, join with the way wey dem use mixin pattern inside with `MixinResolver`. Make we break am down:

1. **Interfaces Implementation**:
   - `ICollateralManager`: This contract dey implement the functions and declarations wey dey for `ICollateralManager` interface. This one mean say the `CollateralManager` contract suppose provide the real deal implementations for the methods wey dey `ICollateralManager`.
   - `Owned`: E fit be another interface or contract wey show ownership. The `CollateralManager` contract fit implement the necessary methods or variables wey go follow `Owned` interface.
   - `Pausable`: Similar to `Owned`, this one fit be another interface or contract wey get to do with pausing. The `CollateralManager` contract carry the needed functions or state variables wey go support pausing functionality.

2. **Mixin Usage**:
   - `MixinResolver`: Dem use am as mixin, wey dey follow the design pattern wey involve mixing classes with methods from another class. For this case, `MixinResolver` dey mixed into the `CollateralManager` contract, e mean say the functionality wey `MixinResolver` dey provide dey inside the `CollateralManager`. This one na the way dem dey reuse code across many contracts.

3. **Libraries Usage**:
   - `using SafeMath for uint`: The `SafeMath` library, wey get arithmetic functions wey go prevent overflow and underflow, dey inside the code using the `using` statement. This one allows the `SafeMath` functions to fit dey used directly with `uint` inside the contract.
   - `using SafeDecimalMath for uint`: Similar to `SafeMath`, this library wey likely be for decimal operations, dey used for `uint` inside the contract.
   - `using AddressSetLib for AddressSetLib.AddressSet`: This one show say dem use the `AddressSetLib` library to manage sets of addresses. The `using` statement allow the `AddressSet` type to get extra functions wey dey from the library.
   - `using Bytes32SetLib for Bytes32SetLib.Bytes32Set`: Similar to the address set, this one show say dem dey use the `Bytes32SetLib` library to manage sets of `bytes32` values. Like the address set, the `using` statement make the `Bytes32Set` type carry extra functions wey dey from the library.

In summary, the `CollateralManager` contract na combination of different functionalities wey dem get from interfaces (`ICollateralManager`, `Owned`, `Pausable`) and mixin (`MixinResolver`). Again, e use different libraries (`SafeMath`, `SafeDecimalMath`, `AddressSetLib`, `Bytes32SetLib`) to handle specific things wey concern arithmetic operations, address sets, and `bytes32` sets. This design promote modularity, the reuse of code, and make sure say the code follow standardized rules.

### CONSTANT STATE VARIABLES.

in Solidity, the state variables declared outside functions are, by default, immutable once they are assigned a value. This means that, once a value is assigned to a state variable, it cannot be changed.

PIGIN(TRANSLATION):

For Solidity, state variables wey dem declare outside functions, by default, na "immutable" once dem don assign value to dem. E mean say, once dem don give value to state variable, you no fit change am again.

#### Example of some constant state variable:

````solidity
bytes32 private constant sUSD = "sUSD";

uint private constant SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR = 31556926 * 1e18;

````
bytes :This line of Solidity code declares a private constant variable named sUSD of type bytes32 and assigns it the value "sUSD"

uint:
This line of Solidity code declares a private constant variable named SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR of type uint (unsigned integer) and assigns it a calculated value representing the number of seconds in a year.

PIGIN(TRANSLATION);
Dis line for Solidity code talk say dem dey declare one private constant wey dem call sUSD. Dis sUSD na 'bytes32' type, and dem don give am value "sUSD".

uint:
Dis line of Solidity code na to declare one private constant wey dem call SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR. Dis SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR na 'uint' type, and dem don give am value wey dem calculate wey represent the number of seconds for one year.

### State variable(5):
A state variable plays a crucial role in establishing and managing the state of a contract by utilizing storage.

PIGIN(TRANSLATION):
State variable dey very important to set and manage the condition of one contract by using storage.

### MAPPING:
"mapping" denotes a data structure designed for the correlation of values with distinct keys. Its functionality bears resemblance to that of a dictionary or an associative array commonly found in other programming languages.

PIGIN(TRANSLATION):

"Mappin" dey show say na data structure wey dem design to join values with beta keys. E resemble well well di way wey dictionary or associative array dey work for oda programming languages.
#### Example of mapping
````SOLIDITY
mapping(bytes32 => bytes32) public synthsByKey;
````
### CONSTRUCTOR 
constructor is a special function in a smart contract that is automatically executed only once when the contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. 

PIGIN(TRANSLATION):

"Constructor na one kain special function inside smart contract wey go run once and na automatic action wen dem deploy the contract to Ethereum blockchain."
#### EXAMPLE
``````solidity
 constructor(
        CollateralManagerState _state,
        address _owner,
        address _resolver,
        uint _maxDebt,
        uint _maxSkewRate,
        uint _baseBorrowRate,
        uint _baseShortRate
    ) public Owned(_owner) Pausable() MixinResolver(_resolver) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        state = _state;
